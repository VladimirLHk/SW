# It`s repository with double aims.
First - improve my skills in Git / GitHub.
Second - summarize my experience in project "Simple Word" (see https://github.com/matthewtff/simple-word).
This project idea is from my doughter and his husband: change words with hard pronunciation letters (user set) to its synonyms.

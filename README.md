# It`s repository with double aims.
The first is to improve my skills in Git / GitHub.
Second aim to summarize my experience in project "Simple Word" (see https://github.com/matthewtff/simple-word).
This project idea is from my daughter and her husband: change words with hard to pronounce letters (user set) to their synonyms.
